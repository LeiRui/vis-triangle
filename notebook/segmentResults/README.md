# Sampled results of segment-based methods for Figure 11-Visualizations of sampled time series

For a fair comparison, we adjust the error thresholds of the segment-based methods FSW and Sim-Piece to produce similar numbers of sampled points. 

Thus, this directory `segmentResults` contains such sampled results of segment-based methods targeting specified numbers of sampled points $m$, generated by the following code in https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/research/LTS-visualization:
